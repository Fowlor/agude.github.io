I use [Google Analytics][analytics] on this website to get a better idea of how many people
are reading my articles, and what websites they come from.

[analytics]: https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/

## What does Google record?

Google records:

- What website you came from (Google search, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.)
- How long you stay on each page
- What type of computer and operating system you are using
- What country you are connecting from

And a bunch more. Please see [Google Analytics's Terms of Service][google_tos].
