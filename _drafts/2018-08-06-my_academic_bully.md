title: "My Academic Bully at CERN"
description: >
  Getting my PhD was mostly a great experience, but one woman made my life
  hell for a short time at CERN. It's tough to write about, but I thought I
  owed it to myself and others.

I am not the kind of person who I thought would be the target of academic
bullying. I am male, I am tall, I am solidly built, and I generally get along
with everyone. Likewise, my abuser was not the kind of person I would have
looked out for. She was a woman, she was short, she did not look threatening
in anyway. And yet within only a few months of meeting her, I was in the
hospital.

Writing this post, even years after the fact, was surprisingly tough; just
thinking back on the events and the person raises my heart rate and makes me
feel anxious and uneasy. But I felt like I had to write it, for me, and for
everyone else who has gone through something similar. I hope that if enough
people speak up, we will eventually be able to fight the abuse instead of
hiding it.

## Heading to CERN, and The Start

In 2012, I went to [CERN][cern] to complete some of my required service work
on the [Compact Muon Solenoid][cms]. Service work is the
mopping and sweeping of experimental physics: it must be done to produce the
scientific results, but it is not really science in and of itself. For my
service work, I was a High Level Trigger (HLT) on-call. I would take
rotations monitoring the system and generally be available to trouble shoot
problems at a moments notice, day or night.

The HLT group ran the on-call program. The group was composed of grad students
and post docs (and some professors) who wrote the software, built the
hardware, and monitored the system. The post doc I worked with from Minnesota
ran part of the group, and his deputy was a French post doc and my eventual
abuser. She did not like me from the get go; I suspect she saw me as a natural
ally to my post doc who she was in competition with.[^1]

The HLT post docs and grad students spent lots of time training me to handle
the responsibilities of the on-call position. In fact, as one of the first
people to go through the training,[^2] they spent extra time with me as any
misunderstanding on my part indicated a problem with the on boarding system.

## The Attacks and My Panic Attack

I do not remember how it started, but it soon became a constant barrage
constant. Emails sent to the entire HLT list telling me that I was an idiot.
Comments in group meetings saying that same. Saying that I was doing a
terrible job. That I was doing the work too slow. That I did not know
anything.

My panic attack came on suddenly. If asked, I would have said that a panic
attack must start with a moment of sheer panic, but mine did not. Mine started
with anger. I had just gotten back to my office from a meeting and opened my
email to find another one from my bully. I clenched my fists, imagining the
cutting response I would never write to shame her and make it stop. And then
it happened: I could not stop clenching my fists, or even move my arms. I sunk
to the floor as my heart raced in fear at having lost control of my movements.

My post doc came back to the office then. He helped me into our Peugeot
Partner CERN van and drove me to the hospital. By the time we got their I felt
off, but could move at least. The doctor did an EKG because of my history of
heart problems but found nothing wrong. He told me to try to avoid the person
who was causing me stress and then discharged me.

## The (Inadequate) Response

I told my adviser I would not work with the bully or in the HLT group anymore.
He agreed to this and found me another service job to work on, which was
great. Removing myself from the group stopped the abuse, but I felt like I let
her win.

For his part, my advisor---whom I love and would highly recommend---did not
handle the response correctly. While he helped to get me out of the abusive
situation, he would later privately defend her to me, implying that she was
difficult to work with but was a really good scientist. Perhaps he was trying
to explain why she would escape punishment, but I did not need to hear that, I
needed his support. And of course, my bully suffered no consequences, and she
is still working at CERN to this day.

## Misc

[Bullying in academia][bullying] is not something you expect going in to your
PhD program. Universities, national and international labs, and even your
research group do not have good systems in place to [deal with brilliant
jerks][jerks]. Most companies, it seems, do not either.

[^2]: Most of the previous on-calls were veterans who did not need in depth training or documentation. They understood the system because they had built it.
