title: "My Academic Bully"

  Getting my PhD was mostly a great experience, but one woman made my life
  hell for a short time at CERN. It's tough to write about, but I thought I
  owed it to myself and others.

I am not the kind of person who I thought would be the target of academic
bullying. I am male, I am tall, I am solidly built, and I generally get along
with everyone. Likewise, my abuser was not the kind of person I would have
looked out for. She was a woman, she was short, she did not look threatening
in anyway. And yet within only a few months of meeting her, I was in the
hospital.

Writing this post, even years after the fact, was surprisingly tough; just
thinking back on the events and the person raises my heart rate and makes me
feel anxious and uneasy. But I felt like I had to write it, for me, and for
everyone else who has gone through something similar. I hope that if enough
people speak up, we will eventually be able to fight the abuse instead of
hiding it.

## Bullying at CERN

In 2012, I went to [CERN][cern] to complete some of my required service work
on the [Compact Muon Solenoid][cms]. Service work is the
mopping and sweeping of experimental physics: it must be done to produce the
scientific results, but it is not really science in and of itself. For my
service work, I was a High Level Trigger (HLT) on-call. I would take
rotations monitoring the system and generally be available to trouble shoot
problems at a moments notice, day or night.

The HLT group ran the on-call program. The group was composed of grad students
and post docs (and some professors) who wrote the software, built the
hardware, and monitored the system. The post doc I worked with from Minnesota
ran part of the group, and his deputy was a French post doc and my eventual
abuser. She did not like me from the get go; I suspect she saw me as a natural
ally to my post doc who she was in competition with.[^1]

The HLT post docs and grad students spent lots of time training me to handle
the responsibilities of the on-call position. In fact, as one of the first
people to go through the training,[^2] they spent extra time with me as any
misunderstanding on my part indicated a problem with the on boarding system.
My bully did not really participate in this process.

## The Attacks





## The (Inadequate) Response

My advisor, whom I love and would highly recommend, handled the situation
poorly.  He did help get me away from my abuser, but he

would defended her privately to
me, implying that she was difficult to work with, but a really thorough
scientist. I believe he was trying to explain why nothing would be done based
on her behavior,

## Misc

[Bullying in academia][bullying] is not something you expect going in to your
PhD program.

[^1]: The more responsibilities you could claim, the better your chances of [landing that rare tenure-track position][phd] most post docs desired.
[^2]: Most of the previous on-calls were veterans who did not need in depth training or documentation. They understood the system because they had built it.
