title: "My Academic Bully"
description: >
  Getting my PhD was mostly a great experience, but one woman made my life
  hell for a short time at CERN. It's tough to write about, but I thought I
  owed it to myself and others.

Writing this post, even years after the fact, was surprisingly tough; just
thinking back on the events and the person raises my heart rate and makes me
feel anxious and uneasy. But I felt like I had to write it, for me, and for
everyone else who has gone through something similar. I hope that if enough
people speak up, we will eventually be able to fight the abuse instead of
hiding it.

I am not the kind of person who I thought would be the target of academic
bullying. I am male, I am tall, I am solidly built, and I generally get along
with everyone. Likewise, my abuser was not the kind of person I would have
looked out for. She was a woman, she was short, she did not look threatening
in anyway. And yet within only a few months of meeting her, I was in the
hospital.

## Bullying at CERN

In 2012 I went to CERN to complete some of my required service work for my
experiment, the [Compact Muon Solenoid][cms]. Service work is the mopping and
sweeping of experimental physics: it must be done to produce the scientific
results, but it is not really science in and of itself. My service work was to
be an High Level Trigger (HLT) on-call, where I would take rotations
monitoring the system and being available to trouble shoot problems at a
moments notice, day or night.

The HLT group that ran the on-call program was composed of grad students and
post docs (and some professors) who wrote the software, built the hardware,
and monitored the system. The post doc I worked with from Minnesota was the
convener of the group, and his deputy was a French post doc.



[Bullying in academia][bullying] is not something you expect going in to your
PhD program.

My advisor, whom I love and would highly recommend, handled the situation
poorly.  He did help get me away from my abuser, but he


would defended her privately to
me, implying that she was difficult to work with, but a really thorough
scientist. I believe he was trying to explain why nothing would be done based
on her behavior,
