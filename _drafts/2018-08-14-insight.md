title: "Insight Data Science: Should I Go?"

  Insight promises an easy transition to a career in data science or machine
  learning, but is it the right program for you? I have a few words of advice
  offered from experience.

Following [Neha's][neha] [advice][advice] about writing a blog post for any
email that you've written over and over, I thought I'd answer a question I get
often: "I'm trying to get a job in data science; should I attend
[Insight][insight]?"

I'm qualified to answer this question because I was an Insight fellow in June
of 2015 in the data science track (DS-SV-2015B). That, of course, is also my
bias: I found my current and previous job through Insight, made a bunch of friends, and am
happy with the experience in general. I am also a technical adviser, meaning I
mentor the fellows weekly in exchange for a small bit of equity in the
company.[^1]

## What is Insight?

Insight is a program to help people find jobs in data science related fields.
Their initial program was the [data science][insight] track---which I will
discuss in the remained of this post---but they have also expanded to cover
various other data-related fields as well. The data science program is offered
multiple cities: Boston, New York, Seattle, Toronto, and the Bay Area. There
is also a remote session that is entirely online. They accept solely PhDs,
mostly from technical fields but with a few other technically minded folk with
liberal arts PhDs. Each program runs for about three months and at the end you
will (ideally) have a job.

## What Would I Do There?

Insight isn't like graduate school. While there are a few talks covering a variety
of useful topics---SQL, start ups and equity, tech interviews, etc.---the
majority of the learning is project based. You pick a project and then spend a
few weeks (feverishly) working on it, learning by doing and by talking to the
people around you. I wrote about my project, [WhereTo.Photo][my_project], if
you are interested in what one of these projects looks like.

The program is structured like this:

- 4 weeks of building a data project
- 3 weeks of demoing the project at various companies
- 3+ weeks of interviewing with companies you demoed at

Throughout the program you receive guidance from the Insight staff (many of
whom were hired out of the program), industry mentors, previous fellows, and
the other fellows that make up your session. This last group **shouldn't be
underestimated**: you learn a lot from the other fellows as you ask each other
for help with your projects. Everyone is an expert at something, and a novice
at something else.

During this time, companies come present what they do and why they need
data scientists. After your project is completed, you put together a list of
the companies that you are interested in talking to. You will get to demo at
**some**, **but not all**, of them because the number of people who can demo
at any company is limited.

Over the next few weeks you show off your project at some of the companies
that you selected (eight per fellow during my session). Some of those
companies will want to take the next step and interview you. When not demoing,
you practice interviewing and brush up on all the topics you are unsure of.

## Why Should I Go?

### Lots of Exposure

Insight is a great way to get a quick survey of about thirty companies in the
area that are all hiring data scientists. From my position in Minnesota I knew
of the big name companies (Apple, Google, Facebook, etc.) but not really any
of the medium or small companies. One of these small companies was the perfect
fit for me and I spent two great years working there; I never would have found
them without Insight to make the introduction.

### A Killer Network

Insight is also a great way to build a professional network. There over a
thousand alumni scattered all across the country. Friends from my session now
work at numerous startups as well as major companies like:
AdRoll, 
Airbnb, 
Facebook, 
Google, 
Instagram, 
Intuit, 
Kabaam!, 
LinkedIn, 
Netflix, 
Salesforce, 
SambaTV, 
Silicon Valley Data Science, 
Stitch Fix, 
and
VEVO.

Building my professional network without Insight would have been much harder.
And such a network is incredibly valuable; every interview (but one) that I
went to 

etwork is how I found my
second job at [Intuit][intuit]!

### Great Friends and Community

Finally, I've made great friends from among the people who went to Insight
with me. This might seem like a minor point, but if you're picking up your
life and moving across the country it is great to have a group you can hang
out with. I regularly go on bike rides, play board games, or just get dinner
with the people from my session.

## Sounds Great! What's the Catch?

Here are some things to consider before you accept your invitation to join
Insight:

### Insight is _Free_, but **EXPENSIVE**

Insight doesn't charge the fellows anything, and they even offer a limited
number of need-based scholarships to help cover expenses. Still, living
without a job for three or four months is hard. In the Bay Area that will
probably cost you about $2000 a month in rent. Insight isn't your employer, so
you won't have health insurance unless you still have it from your school
(mine lasted over the summer after I graduated, thankfully) or buy it
yourself. I had a good amount of savings from grad school which were just
about wiped out by the three months renting in Palo Alto, and other fellows in
my session charged up their credit cards to get by. We are all doing fine now,
but it was stressful before we had job offers.

### Not Everyone Finds a Job in Three Months

Insight claims that the vast majority of fellows find a job in the industry,
and this is true, but they don't promise that it will happen within the three
months. Everyone in my session who stuck with it got a job that they loved in
data science, but for a few of them it took a long time. About a third of my
class had offers within a week or two, another third took about a month or
slightly longer, and the last third dragged out over a few months with one or
two of my friends taking four or more months. I've known fellows in other
sessions who have taken six months of interviewing to get an offer.

### You Need to Know How To Code

Data scientists need to know how to work with data, but they also need to know
how to code. A good grasp of at least one language is a must, and it would be
very tough to pick up coding from scratch at Insight. If you can't write
[FizzBuzz][fizz] then you will have catching up to do. This is especially true
for machine learning positions, which have interviews that more closely follow
the "standard" developer interview pattern of writing code on the white board
over and over and over again.

## Final Thoughts

So should you go? I think, for me, it was worth it because the benefits you I
got from Insight live on well after the program.
