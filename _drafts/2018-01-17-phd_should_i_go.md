title: "Should I Get a PhD?"
description: >
  In 2009, having little or no money in my purse, I thought I would go to
  graduate school in physics. But was it the right idea? And should you follow
  in my footsteps?

I've known I was going to be a physics professor since I was fourteen, so when
I finished my BA at Berkeley it never even crossed my mind to do anything but
go to graduate school. You had to go to graduate school to be a professor, and
I was going to be one.

Seven years later, as a freshly minted PhD in particle physics, I went
straight to [Insight Data Science][insight] to begin a career in Silicon
Valley. I never even applied for a postdoc position.

Although I thoroughly enjoyed my six years in Minnesota[^1], I sometimes ask
myself "Would I do it again?". I also get asked "Should I go?" by young
students, often looking to get into data science themselves. I can't answer
that definitively for you, but I can tell you some truths about my experience
that might inform your decision.

## You learn a lot

I learned some highly specialized knowledge in graduate school---relativity
and quantum mechanics and particle cross-sections. Other knowledge was
extremely useful, but completely unrelated to physics---how to work with large
datasets, how to be skeptical of your conclusions, how to communicate results,
and how to manage your time. But the most useful things I learned were about
myself---to have confidence in my ability, that I was a worthwhile human, that
I was more than just a physicist.

I understand myself better having gone through grad school, and I am in many
ways a more complete person. I also developed some marketable skills, but what
I feel like I really gained was the confidence to sell the skills that I did
have.

## And it is a lot of fun

Graduate school, if you find a good adviser, is also a lot of fun. You meet
hundreds of people who share the exact same passion as you, and you get to
spend six years having lunch and dinner parties with them all while riding
bikes and hiking and rock climbing and whatever else you like to do. I met
many of my best friends in graduate school and, with the exception of Insight,
it has been the best source of contacts in my professional network.

## But there are no jobs

Graduate school was a slow yet constant realization that there were no [jobs in
my field][nature]. Going into grad school I had naively assumed that everyone that
wanted one, or most everyone at least, got a faculty job. But as I watched
brilliant postdoc after brilliant postdoc leave the field, each failing to get
even a single offer after trying for years, I realized that I had been wrong.
The year I left with my PhD, my experiment of nearly 3000 scientists placed
only around ten postdocs into US-based tenure track positions. Those are
terrible odds.

## And the opportunity cost is very high

You don't spend your own money on a graduate degree,[^2] but it is still [very
expensive][op_cost]. You spend six or seven years training for a job you will
not get. You learn a lot along the way, but you could certainly learn the
useful things in a much shorter amount of time.

[op_cost]: TODO

In six years, if you get rid of the physics courses and exams and teaching,
you could fit a lot of training and on-the-job experience. Most of the
on-the-job experience I got in graduate school was not at all applicable to
the job I have now, and most hiring managers view it that way as well.

## But wait, I want to be a data scientist

In the end, teaching the useful skills in a much shorter amount of time is
what the master programs in data science, and eventually the undergraduate
degrees, will attempt to do. And I believe they will, after some trial and
error, succeed. So if your goal is to be a data scientist, ask yourself this:
would you rather have a masters in data science and four or five years of
experience that industry, or would you rather be fresh out of a PhD program
with no "practical" experience in the field?

## Would I do it again?

It's hard to answer because I really like how my life has ended up. I would be
in a completely different place---in terms of my family and my career and my
personality---had I not gone. And yet, it is hard for me to recommend for the
reasons above. If you absolutely know you are going to be a professor[^3] then
go, but if you just want to break into data science, I'd consider other
options.
