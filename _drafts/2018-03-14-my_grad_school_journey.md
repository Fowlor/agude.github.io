title: "The Typical Successful Career Starts with Rejection"
description: >
  I think I have been relatively successful in my career so far, even though
  it is nothing like I thought it would be. But it didn't start out looking
  that way.

[Moritz Hardt][mrtz] posted a [tweet][mrtz_tweet] the other day saying "It's
that time of the year to keep in mind that the typical start of a successful
academic career is getting rejected from a bunch of good grad schools." This
led to a lot of successful people replying about their own failures and how
they did not stop them.

## My Career

[I do not have an academic career][phd], but I have done OK, so I thought I'd
share my story, which shows that a successful career can start after being
reject by every graduate school you applied to.

I wanted to be a Physicist since I was fourteen, so the path
was laid before me: BA, PhD, professor.

I did my BA at Berkeley. I got started in research early, working for [Saul
Perlmutter][saul] starting in 2005. I studied hard, graduate with honors,
wrote [a thesis][thesis], worked on some [papers][papers]. The next step was
graduate school, which meant writing essays and taking the GRE.

I studied for the Physics GRE, but doing so made me anxious---I knew how
important it was---so I avoided doing it, or did it in ways that made me less
anxious. And it didn't work; I did terribly. I hoped it wouldn't make a
difference, but it did: I got into none of the graduate schools I applied to
in 2008.

I tried again in 2009. Not the GRE, thinking about it brought even more
anxiety after the first time, but applying. Thankfully, the [University of
Minnesota][umn] (and more specifically, the too kind [Yuichi Kubota][yk])
looked past my test scores and gave me a spot. I wasn't the only person he
gave a chance to.
