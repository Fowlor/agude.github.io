title: "The Typical Successful Career Starts with Rejection"
description: >
  I think I have been relatively successful in my career so far, even though
  it is nothing like I thought it would be. But it didn't start out looking
  that way.

[Moritz Hardt][mrtz] posted a [tweet][mrtz_tweet] the other day saying "It's
that time of the year to keep in mind that the typical start of a successful
academic career is getting rejected from a bunch of good grad schools." This
led to a lot of successful people replying about their own failures and how
they did not stop them.

## My Story

[I do not have an academic career][phd], but I have done OK. Moritz's tweet
made me want to share my story as well, which is this: a successful career can
start after being reject by every graduate school you applied to.

I wanted to be a Physicist since I was fourteen, so the path was laid before
me: BA, PhD, professor. I did my BA at Berkeley. The next step was graduate
school, which meant writing essays and taking the GRE. But the GRE made me
anxious, so I studied poorly, and I did terribly. I got into none of the
graduate schools I applied to in 2008.

I tried again in 2009. Not the GRE, thinking about it brought even more
anxiety after the first time, but applying. Thankfully, the [University of
Minnesota][umn] (and more specifically, the too kind [Yuichi Kubota][yk])
looked past my test scores and gave me a spot. I wasn't the only person he
gave a chance to, but I'm thankful that I was one of them.

## And Onward

I graduated from grad school in 2015 and went to [Insight Data
Science][insight]. From there I got a job doing machine learning at
[Lab41][lab41], where I published [a paper][paper] ([arXiv][arxiv]) and spent
two great years. Now I lead a data science group at [Intuit][intuit]. Failing
to get into graduate school in 2008 was crushing at the time, but it did not
hurt me in the long run.
