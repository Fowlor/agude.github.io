  Interviewing is notoriously agonizing for both the candidate and the

A lot has been written about how to perform technical interviews. What
questions to ask, what questions not to ask, why the questions we used to ask
are bad. I have nothing of value to add to that debate.[^1]

What I do have to add is one guiding principle: **Do not waste anyone's
time!**

Do not waste the time of the candidate by making them jump through endless
hoops. Do not waste the time of your own people who are interviewing
candidates by losing candidates due to poor communication. To this end, I have
two simple pieces of advice that very few of the companies I have interviewed
with have followed.

## Structure: Just Enough

A few companies I have interviewed with have had labyrinthine processes
including multiple phone screens, multiple days of on sites, phone screens and
take-home projects. Instead, ask what you hope to learn with a second
interview (or phone screen, or data challenge) that you failed to learn the
first time, and then figure out how to learn that key piece of information in
just one round.

I think the following steps are enough:

- Resume screen (performed without the candidate)
- Casual chat about the position
- Technical screen
- On-site

## Communicate: Often

The vast majority of companies communicate poorly during the hiring process.
There are long periods of silence followed by unpredictable bursts of noise.
Worse, some companies just stop communicating altogether! The companies that
offered the best experience had recruiters who stayed in constant contact, who
set appointments and kept them. The absolute best even scheduled the post
on-site feedback (and hiring decision) phone call at the same time they gave
me the schedule for the on-site itself. I very much appreciated knowing that
at a set time in the future I would know the outcome.

Being better at communicating is easy. Communicate before each step in the
hiring process and let the candidate know what to expect. Then communicate
after each step and let the candidate know whether they are moving on, or not.
Ideally, schedule these interactions ahead of time so there is no doubt as to
when they will happen. This gives the candidate a fixed date on which they
will have an answer, and gives a deadline to the hiring team to make a
decision.

## That's It

It is tough to hire, but it is not tough to be better at structuring
interviews. Respect the time of all parties involved and you will be well on
your way to a better experience for the candidates and the interviewers.
